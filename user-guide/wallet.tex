\chapter{Wallet and Transactions}
The wallet manages a secp256k1 key pair and derives your address. It can build and sign transactions using the current blockchain state, so submitting a \texttt{tx} command automatically produces a properly signed transaction. Use \texttt{balance} at any time to view your wallet's current balance.

On startup the node looks for a \texttt{wallet.key} file and generates one if it is missing. When a new chain is created the genesis block credits this wallet with 100 tokens, giving it an initial balance. Additional funds arrive via incoming transactions or by receiving block rewards when you mine.

Set the \texttt{WALLET\_PASSWORD} environment variable before starting a node to encrypt the wallet's private key. The file will then be written with an \texttt{enc:} prefix and must be decrypted using the same password on subsequent runs.

\chapter{Chain Persistence and Logging}
Blocks are stored in a RocksDB database. The database lives in a directory (default \texttt{chain\_db}) which can be changed with the \texttt{--chain-dir} argument. Each block is written atomically so crashes cannot corrupt previously committed data.

Output is produced using the \texttt{tracing} framework. Control log verbosity by setting the \texttt{RUST\_LOG} environment variable, for example \texttt{RUST\_LOG=info}.

This project is intended for learning and experimentation only and has not been audited for production use.

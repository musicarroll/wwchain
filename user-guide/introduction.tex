\chapter{Introduction}
WWChain is a minimal blockchain prototype written in Rust. Each node maintains its own chain, shares blocks and transactions over TCP and keeps a simple list of peers. Blocks are produced whenever new transactions are submitted, so chain growth is event-driven rather than periodic. The project exists for learning and experimentation rather than production use.

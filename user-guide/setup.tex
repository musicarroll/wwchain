\chapter{Installation and Setup}
Ensure the Rust toolchain is installed. Build the project with:
\begin{verbatim}
cargo build
\end{verbatim}
This compiles the code and fetches all needed dependencies. The \texttt{./setup.sh} script installs Rust if necessary, runs tests and generates documentation to prepare the environment.
